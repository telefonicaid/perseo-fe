## Introduction

This section elaborates on proposed new features or tasks which are expected to be added to the product in the
foreseeable future. There should be no assumption of a commitment to deliver these features on specific dates or in the
order given. The development team will be doing their best to follow the proposed dates and priorities, but please bear

-   Note we develop this software in Agile way, so development plan is continuously under review. Thus, this roadmap has
    to be understood as rough plan of features to be done along time which is fully valid only at the time of writing
    it. This roadmap has not be understood as a commitment on features and/or dates.
-   Some of the roadmap items may be implemented by external community developers, out of the scope of GE owners. Thus,
    the moment in which these features will be finalized cannot be assured.

## Short term

The following list of features are planned to be addressed in the short term, and incorporated in the next release:

-   Upgrade Esper to 8.8

## Medium term

The following list of features are planned to be addressed in the medium term, typically within the subsequent
release(s) generated in the next **9 months** after next planned release:

-   Rule scope beyond subservice: support dynamic creation of EPL context associated to notification path
-   Accept scripts and java snipets
-   No signal rules based in NGSIv2 API instead of MongoDB direct access #549

## Long term

The following list of features are proposals regarding the longer-term evolution of the product even though development
of these features has not yet been scheduled for a release in the near future. Please feel free to contact us if you
wish to get involved in the implementation or influence the roadmap

-   Support for geospatial analysis (geo-fencing, point-based actions, movement-based actions)
-   Rule templates (i.e. having a rule template that can be instantiated to create particular instances of the rule).
    The idea is be able to create complex rules only providing some parameters.
-   Include AI models as part of the rule (condition).
