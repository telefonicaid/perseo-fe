# Plain rules

Plain rules allow a full customization of a rule with specific needs by means of setting the final EPL statement used by the Esper engine inside perseo-core. In order to work with perseo (front-end) properly, the EPL statement must fulfill several conventions for the rule to be able to operate on the incoming events and trigger adequate actions.

The “anatomy” of a rule is as follows

```json
{
   "name":"blood_rule_update",
   "text":"select *,\"blood_rule_update\" as ruleName, *, ev.BloodPressure? as Pression, ev.id? as Meter from pattern [every ev=iotEvent(cast(cast(BloodPressure?,String),float)>1.5 and type=\"BloodMeter\")]",
   "action":{
      "type":"update",
      "parameters":{
         "name":"abnormal",
         "value":"true",
         "type":"boolean"
      }
   }
}
```
The fields (all must be present) are

* **name**: name of the rule, used as identifier
* **text**: EPL statment for the rule engine in perseo-core
* **action**: action to be performed by perseo if the rule is fired from the core

## EPL text
The field ```text``` of the rule must be a valid EPL statement and additionally must honor several restrictions to match expectations of perseo and perseo-core.

EPL is documented in [Esper web] (http://esper.codehaus.org/esper-4.7.0/doc/reference/en-US/html_single/index.html#epl_clauses)

A EPL statement to use with perseo could be:

```
select *, "blood_rule_update" as ruleName,
	 ev.BloodPressure? as Pression, ev.id? as Meter
from pattern
 [every ev=iotEvent(cast(cast(BloodPressure?,String),float)>1.5 and type="BloodMeter")]
```


* The rule name must be present with **ruleName** alias. It must be equal to the ‘name’ field of the rule object
* The *from* pattern must name the event as **ev** and the event stream from which take events must be **iotEvent**
* A *type=* condition must be concatenated for avoiding mixing different kinds of entities

The used entity's atrributes must be cast to `float` in case of being numeric (like  in the example). Alphanumeric values must be cast to `String`. Nested cast to string and to float is something we are analyzing, and could be unnecessary in a future version. Use it by now. All the attributes in the notification from Orion are available in the event object, **ev**,  like *ev.BlodPressure?* and *ev.id?*. A question mark is *necessary* for EPL referring ‘dynamic’ values.

## Actions

When a rule is fired, the "complex event" generated by the select clause is sent to perseo (front-end) which executes the action using the generated event as parameter to the action.

There are a predefined set of actions: sending a SMS,  sending  a email, updating an attribute of the entity that fired the rule and making a HTTP POST to a provided URL.



The action must be provided in the ```action``` field of rule. An example:
```json
   "action":{
      "type":"update",
      "parameters":{
         "name":"abnormal",
         "value":"true",
         "type":"boolean"
      }
   }

```

The `type` field is mandatory and must be one of
* `update`: update an entity's attribute
* `sms`: send a SMS
* `email`: send an email
* `post`: make an HTTP POST

The actions `sms`, `email`, `post` include a field `template` used to build the body of message/request. This text can include placeholders for attributes of the generated event. That placeholder has the form `${` *attribute* `}` which will be substituted by the value of the event's attribute.  The name of the attribute must be prefixed with "ev__" if no alias in the `select` clause is provided. All alias for simple event attributes or "complex" calculated values can be directly used in the placeholder with their name. Any of the original event attributes can be referred as **ev__** *name* (double underscore), if an alias hasn't been given to them.

### SMS action

Sends a SMS to a number set as an action paramter with the body of the message built from the template
```json
 "action": {
        "type": "sms",
        "template": "Meter ${Meter} has pression ${Pression}.",
        "parameters": {
            "to": "123456789"
        }
    }
```
The field `parameters` include a field `to` with the number to send the message to.

### email action

Sends an email to the recipient set in the action parameters, with the body mail build from the `template` field. A field `to` in `parameters` sets the recipient and a field `from`sets the sender's email address.

```json
 "action": {
        "type": "email",
        "template": "Meter ${Meter} has pression ${Pression} (GEN RULE)",
        "parameters": {
            "to": "someone@telefonica.com",
            "from": "cep@system.org"
        }
    }
```

### update attribute action
Updates an specified attribute of the entity which caused the rule to be fired.
This action does not use any value from the generated event  (except the id from the originating entity, but this is done transparently). The `parameters` field includes a field `name` for the name of the attribute to be changed and a `value` field with the value to be put in the attribute.


```json
 "action": {
        "type": "update",
        "parameters": {
            "name": "abnormal",
            "value": "true"
        }
    }
```

### HTTP POST action
Makes an HTTP POST to an URL specified in `url` inside `parameters`, sending a body built from `template`.


```json
 "action": {
        "type": "post",
        "template": "Meter ${Meter} has pression ${Pression}.",
        "parameters": {
            "url": "localhost:1111"
        }
    }
```

### twitter action

Updates the status of a twitter account, with the text build from the `template` field. The field `parameters` must contain the values for the consumer key and secret and the access token key and access token secret of the pre-provisioned application associated to the twitter user.

```json
 "action": {
        "type": "twitter",
        "template": "Meter ${Meter} has pression ${Pression} (GEN RULE)",
        "parameters": {
          "consumer_key": "xvz1evFS4wEEPTGEFPHBog",
          "consumer_secret": "L8qq9PZyRg6ieKGEKhZolGC0vJWLw8iEJ88DRdyOg",
          "access_token_key": "xvz1evFS4wEEPTGEFPHBog",
          "access_token_secret": "L8qq9PZyRg6ieKGEKhZolGC0vJWLw8iEJ88DRdyOg"
        }
    }
```
