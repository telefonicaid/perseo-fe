# Logs

Logs have levels `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `INFO` and `DEBUG`. The log level must be set in the configuration file `config.js`

```javascript
/**
 * Default log level. Can be one of: 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'FATAL'
 * @type {string}
 */
config.logLevel = 'INFO';
```

 In order to have logs that can enable alarms being raised and ceased, `ERROR` level (or one with more detail) should be
set in the configuration file. Generally, `ERROR` level should be used at least, as some important information can be 
lost in other case (e.g. when set to `FATAL`)


Each log line contains several fields of the form *name*`=` *value*, separated by `|`
* `time` time of the log
* `lvl` log level
* `from` IP from X-Real-IP header field or client's IP if missing
* `corr` correlator from the incoming request that caused the current transaction. It allows trace a global operation through several systems. If not present as field header in the incoming request, the internal transaction id will be used.
* `trans` internal transaction id
* `op`  description of the operation being done. Generally, the path of the URL invoked.
* `msg` message

```
time=2014-12-16T12:01:46.487Z | lvl=ERROR | corr=62d2f662-37de-4dcf-ba02-013642501a2d | trans=62d2f662-37de-4dcf-ba02-013642501a2d | op=/actions/do | msg=emailAction.SendMail connect ECONNREFUSED
```

Logs for errors can show additional info in the message, giving a hint of the root cause of the problem (`ECONNREFUSED`,`ENOTFOUND`, `ECONNRESET`, ...)

The log level can be changed at run-time, with an HTTP PUT request

```
 curl --request PUT <host>:<port>/admin/log?level=<FATAL|ERROR|WARN|INFO|DEBUG>
 ```

The log level can be retrieved at run-time, with an HTTP GET request

```
 curl --request GET <host>:<port>/admin/log
 ```


# Alarms

Alarm levels

* **Critical** - The system is not working
* **Major** - The system has a problem that degrades the service and must be addressed
* **Warning** - It is happening something that must be notified

Alarms will be inferred from logs typically. For each alarm, a 'detection strategy' and a 'stop condition' is provided 
(note that the stop condition is not shown in the next table, but it is included in the detailed description for each 
alarm below). The conditions are used for detecting logs that should raise the alarm and cease it respectively. The log 
level for alarms is `ERROR` if no other level is said. The message in a condition should be taken as a **prefix** of the 
possible message in the log. We recommend you to ignore starting spaces in each field in order to avoid missing a log 
that should meet the condition in other case. 

Some errors avoid perseo to start up. They have `FATAL` level and are caused by
* There is no connection to database
* There is no connection to perseo-core

They should be solved in order to get perseo running.
