Usage:
   $progName <NEW_VERSION> [dev | cc | sprint]
        Creates a new release changing the version to the one specified in the arguments.
        The second argument indicates what type of release is it going to be released:

        - sprint: releases that are meant to be created each sprint end. A tag is automatically
        generated along with the branch and develop is merged with master.

        - cc: code complete releases meant to be created when the product is about to go
        into production with the rest of the platform. No tag is generated and master is not
        updated.

        - dev: intermediate releases that do not require following the same SCM specs.
